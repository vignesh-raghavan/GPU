FASTEST IMPLEMENTATION OF JACOBI ITERATIVE SOLVER ON GPU (~810x FASTER THAN CPU).

SHARED MEMORY FOR FREQUENTLY ACCESSED VECTOR.

COLUMN MAJOR ORDERING FOR MATRIX A, TO IMPROVE MEMORY COALESCING.

REMOVE THREAD DIVERGENCE WITHIN A THREAD BLOCK (ALSO A WARP).

KERNEL FOR JACOBI ITERATIVE SOLVER.

NO MEMCPY USED IN k-ITERATIONS OF JACOBI ITERATIVE SOLVER (PREVIOUS RESULTS OF VECTOR STORED IN SHARED MEMORY).
